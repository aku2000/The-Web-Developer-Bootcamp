# The-Web-Developer-Bootcamp

->In this Journey of learning Web Development, in the Frontend part of the course I learnt about HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap(v3.3.7 and v4.5), Flexbox, Javascript, DOM Manipulation and jQuery while creating beautiful, responsive portfolio sites, landing pages for startups, complex HTML forms with validations, responsive navbars. I also developed Javascript-based exciting browser games which include the RGB Color Guessing Game and the famous Patatap Clone along with an animated todo list application. 

->In the Backend part, I learnt about NodeJS, NPM, ExpressJS, REST, MongoDB, Database Associations, Authentication, PassportJS and Authorization while creating a complicated Yelp-like application from scratch and making use of all the above tools to get hands-on experience.
